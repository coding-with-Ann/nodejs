// NODEMON | TIME SAVING MODULE

//Whenever we make changes to code we have to run node file.js agian and again
//This will waste a lot of time, using nodemon solves this problem.
//Nodemon runs the project continuously so we dont have to do it manually.
//As it saves time it got the name time saving module.
//To install nodemon use <npm i nodemon -g>  here -g indicates that we are
// installing nodemon globally so we dont need to install it again in another project.


console.warn("Try nodemon")

// to run file using nodemon use command <nodemon ./filename.js>

// Node js is single threaded but async so its fast.
