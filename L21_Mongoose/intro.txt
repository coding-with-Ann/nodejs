MONGOOSE is a npm package used to connect node js with mongodb
mongodb npm package we used earlier has some limitations
These limitations are fulfilled by MONGOOSE
It provides some advanced features, like models and schemas.
We can cotrol the no of fields in MONGOOSE.

MONGOOSE contains two parts schema and model.

Schemas used to validate the fields in database.
like defining the no of fields, if we have define fields as name, salary in schema
we can't add new filed while inserting data.
We can also use type validations.

Model connects node js with mongodb.
